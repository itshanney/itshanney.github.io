## Hello

I'm Justin Hanney, a software developer in Seattle, where the beer and coffee are too good to leave.

## I Write Code

Most of my time is spent writing code for fun and to earn a living. Currently, I write code to make the global shipping trade more efficient at <a href="http://www.tideworks.com">Tideworks</a>.  In my past I've written code that powers the International Space Station as well as Amazon's Customer Reviews, internal analytics and Kindle.
