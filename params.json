{"name":"Justin Hanney","tagline":"Code. Beer. Seattleite.","body":"### Welcome\r\nI'm Justin Hanney, a software developer in Seattle. I spent most of my life in North Carolina but plan to remain in Seattle because the beer and coffee are too good to leave.\r\n\r\n### I Write Code\r\nMost of my time is spent writing code for fun and to earn a living. Currently, I write code to make the global shipping trade more efficient at [Tideworks](http://www.tideworks.com).  In my past I've written code that powers the International Space Station as well as Amazon's Customer Reviews, internal analytics and Kindle.\r\n\r\n### I Use Social Media\r\nThe NSA can track me on the following services.  Feel free to track me too.\r\n* [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/itshanney)\r\n* [Instagram](http://www.twitter.com/jmhanney)\r\n* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/itshanney)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
